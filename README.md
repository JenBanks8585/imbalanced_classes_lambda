# Highly imbalanced classes in Binary classification.

# 2 minute summary
- Classification is when you are trying to classify elements of a set. When there are two groups, it's binary classification. 
- There are issues when the event really rare, for example: fraud, cancer, device failure


This repository is organized into the following sections:

1. What are imbalanced classes?

2. Why is it a problem with classification?

3. Performance metrics

4. Balanced Random Forest

5. Dataset resampling

6. Emsembling + Oversampling

7. XGBoost

8. SVM, KNN - Anomaly detection
