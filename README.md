# Highly imbalanced classes in Binary classification.

# 2 minute summary
- Classification is when you are trying to classify elements of a set. When there are two groups, it's binary classification. 
- If the event is really rare, there can be problems in building a machine learning model. 
- Common examples include fraud, cancer, and device failure
- We should be concerned about how we evaluate our model and how we construct our training data. 

This repository is organized into the following sections:

1. What are highly imbalanced classes?

2. Why is it a problem with classification?

3. Performance metrics

4. Balanced Random Forest

5. Dataset resampling

6. Emsembling + Oversampling

7. XGBoost

8. SVM, KNN - Anomaly detection
